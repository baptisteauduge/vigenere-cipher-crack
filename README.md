# Vigenere Cipher

This project is about the Vigenere Cipher, a method of encrypting alphabetic text. It uses a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. A polyalphabetic cipher uses multiple substitution alphabets to encrypt the data. The Vigenere Cipher uses a keyword to shift the letters in the plaintext to create the ciphertext.

This project is a part of the course "Cryptography" (3I024) at Sorbonne University.

## What we did

We implemented the Vigenere Cipher in Python. We also implemented a method to crack the Vigenere Cipher using:
 - The IC (Index of Coincidence)
 - The ICM (Index of Coincidence Mutual)
 - The Pearson Correlation Coefficient
